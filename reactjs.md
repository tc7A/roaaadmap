- Passing arguments to event handlers
- Synthetic events in React

## 5. Forms and Input Handling
- Controlled vs. uncontrolled components
- Managing form state with `useState`
- Handling form submissions
- Validation and error handling

## 6. React Router (Client-side Routing)
- Installing and setting up `react-router-dom`
- Configuring routes with `<Routes>` and `<Route>`
- Navigating between pages using `<Link>` and `useNavigate`
- Dynamic routing and route parameters
- Protected routes and authentication checks

## 7. State Management
- Prop drilling and lifting state up
- Context API for global state management
- Third-party state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Jotai)
- Redux basics:
  - Actions, reducers, and the store
  - Using `react-redux` with hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`)

## [8. React Hooks](#)
- [Common hooks:](#)
  - [`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`](#)
- [Advanced hooks:](#)
  - [`useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`](#)
  - [`useRef` for DOM manipulation and persisting values](#)
- [Creating custom hooks for reusable logic](#)

## 9. Fetching Data from APIs
- Fetching data using:
  - `fetch` or `axios`
  - React Query or SWR (for advanced use cases)
- Handling loading states and errors
- Using `useEffect` for API calls
- Integrating with the backend (Node.js + Express APIs)

## 10. Styling in React
- Inline styles and CSS classes
- CSS Modules
- Styled-components and Emotion
- Using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS
- Understanding `className` vs `style`

## 11. Error Handling
- Handling component errors with error boundaries
- Using `try-catch` for asynchronous operations
- Displaying user-friendly error messages

## 12. Performance Optimization
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Memoizing components with `React.memo`
- Optimizing expensive computations with `useMemo`
- Optimizing event handlers with `useCallback`
- Code-splitting and lazy loading using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`

## 13. Testing React Applications
- Writing unit tests with `Jest`
- Testing components with `React Testing Library`
- Mocking API calls and user interactions
- End-to-end testing with tools like Cypress

## 14. Authentication and Authorization
- Managing user authentication state
- Using JWT for token-based authentication
- Storing tokens securely (e.g., `localStorage`, `httpOnly` cookies)
- Protecting routes and components (e.g., with `<PrivateRoute>`)

## 15. Real-time Updates
- Integrating with WebSocket libraries (e.g., `socket.io-client`)
- Using state management for real-time UI updates

## 16. Building and Deploying React Apps
- Building production-ready React apps (`npm run build`)
- Hosting on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
- Integrating the React frontend with an Express backend
- Configuring environment variables in React

## 17. Advanced Topics (Optional)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Internationalization (i18n) with libraries like `react-i18next`
- React animations with libraries like `Framer Motion` or `React Spring`
- Working with GraphQL (e.g., Apollo Client)
